# Ublock Firefox Hardmode List and Filters

This will slowly evolve over time as we work to make it function on more and more sites. This should provide heavy ad blocking, script blocking, and deligate away as much "accept cookie" and "news" nagware as possible.

# How to install

To start, enable [Advanced User mode](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Advanced-user-features), but to explain it simply here, click the uBlock Origin icon in the upper right of Firefox, click the gears icon, scroll down if nessecary, and check the box labled "I am an advanced user".

## Filters

In that same settings menu as stated above, head over to the "My Filters" tab at the top, then either import the filters file using the "Import and append" button, or simply copy and paste the text from this file into this feild, click apply changes, and you're done with the filters. You can follow the same process to update them as things progress.

## Rules

Same settings menu as before, but this time we head over to "My Rules", also at the top, and you'll follow the exact same steps for the filter process, as well as upgrading them, but instead, you'll want to click Save on the right hand side, then click commit to commit it to the primary rules list.

Alternatively, for the updgrades, you can simply paste the new list under the previous list, and uBlock will sort them, and clear out duplicates, which should make the process simpler.
